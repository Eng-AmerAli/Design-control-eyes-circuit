# Design-control-eyes-circuit
In this task, I worked on designing the circuit of the eyes of the robot, and before I explain the two circuits, I chose to have the circuit connect in parallel, because it gives a constant voltage and I can control the voltage of each LED by resistance, and this is best option.

I made two designs for the circuit. The first design used the Arduino to be able to control when he blinks his eyes or blinks after 5 seconds, so that I can control all these details through the Arduino code.

As for the second design, it was only connected to the power source so that I  I can't control it, I can only turn it off and turn it on
